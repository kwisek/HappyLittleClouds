# HappyLittleClouds
 
Proud to present my first ever Unity project created after a full day of studying its secrets.

## How to play

You will encounter 2 types of clouds: grey and white. White clouds are the happy ones. You can control them to make contact with grey clouds. When a happy cloud touches a sad cloud, sad one turn happy and from now on you can control it as well. Finish the game by making all clouds happy.

## Further development ideas

* Add more levels
* Mess around with Unity physics to make the gameplay funnier
